If the underlying data is meant to be continuous, but due to physical limits, could
only be captured in a discrete format, interpolation is the way to go.
Examples: Medical Scan Data (Quantitative Data), Hurricane Data (Also Quantitative Data)
On the other hand, it makes little sense to apply interpolation on data, that is
categorical.
Examples: Statistics about the Program of Students (Categorical), Shirt Size of a
Person (S/M/L Ordinal)
