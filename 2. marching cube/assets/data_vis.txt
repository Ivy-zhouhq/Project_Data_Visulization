You would need an Algorithm to handle these ambiguous cases.
In 2D we needed to look at an additional point to handle Saddle Points.
An intuitive but inaccurate way to fix this in 3D, would be to just stuff the holes with additional triangles.
A better way would be with an asymptotic decider.
It iterates over all faces on an ambiguous cube and uses bilinear interpolation, to connect the vertices of triangles on that face.
This always results in a hyperbola.
Then it calculates the value at the intersection of the two asymptotes.
Based on this value it then resolves ambiguity as in the 2D case.
