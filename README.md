### Implementation of different interpolation techniques in volumetric datasets

1. Nearest neighbour approach in uniformed data
2. Trilinear interpolation in uniformed data
3. Nearest neighbour approach in unstructured data

### Implementation marching cubes,a technique for extracting isosurfaces in volumetric data.

To change the view in the application, you simply hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse, use the scroll to zoom in or out. However, you will not see any mesh until you have implemented the functionality of marching cubes inside of Triangulate. cpp.

### Implementation volumetric ray-casting on both the CPU and GPU
1. implement ray-casting using the front-to-back emission absorption model
2. implement a simple phong shading model 
3. implement Early Ray Termination for your CPU ray-caster and document the performance gains
